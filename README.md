# About
My first project - Java Game/3D engine made using low level LWJGL library. It took 2 years of everyday development and refactoring. This project was mostly used to learn programming.

# Content
Features:
-[x] Geomipmapping - reducting LoD (Level of Detail) based on distance from the camera,
-[x] Instancing - rendering multiple simple objects like grass tuffs or particles using GPU acceleration,
-[x] Custom Vertex-Fragment shader pipelines,
-[x] Skybox implementation,
-[x] Physics simulation,
-[x] Custom terrain collision using barrycentrics coordination system and vector math,
-[x] Mipmaping and antyaliasing,
-[x] Postprocessing,
-[x] Custom GUI and dedicated library.

# Results
The results can be seen on my old YT channel.
